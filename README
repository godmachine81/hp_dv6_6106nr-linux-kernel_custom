Linux Kernel Version 4.x.x (updated along side mainline beginning at 
4.0 RC3) - Customized specifically for Hewlett Packard Pavilion 
DV6-6106nr Notebook/Laptop.  

Please notice that this kernel configuration and/or any binary files 
contained within this repository are AS-IS and should only be used by 
people who know how to properly modify a kernel configuration, compile 
the kernel and modules, and install it applying necessary changes to the 
bootloader.  Again this kernel is made specifically FOR the HP 
DV6-6106nr Notebook/Laptop.  Use at your own risk!

This has only been tested and verified stable on the above mentioned 
platform.  Advanced developers / hackers may be able to use this same 
kernel configuration / binary /initrd with similar notebook motherboards 
/ cpus.

This is specifically optimized for the AMD A8 Series Llano socket FS1.

Test machine specs:

HP-DV6 6106nr
8GB 1600mhz Gskill value ram
500GB HDD (sata atiixp chipset)
AMD A8-3550MX 2.0ghz/2.4ghz (stock/boost)  Kernel Provides 2.0ghz - 
2.7ghz stable overclock on all 4 cores.
ATI/AMD Radeon HD 6620G APU (radeon open source driver)
Sensors - k10temp (apu/cpu thermal)
HDA_Intel Audio (IDT/Sigmatel Codec) (verified all input/output controls 
working)
HP TruVision HD Video Camera - UVC (verified working)
Realtek RTL8111/8168 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet controller
Ralink corp. RT5390 Wireless 802.11n 1T/1R PCIe (working firmware 
built-in)


*Radeon driver is the only one compiled as module that is a permanent 
device on the system - This was purposely done for those who would 
rather use fglrx/catalyst proprietary drivers.  You may blacklist the 
radeon module to prevent conflicts.

*Default CPU governor is set to userspace to allow optimal performance / 
efficiency controlled from userland instead of kernel.

*SLUB Memory Allocator

*I/O Scheduler(s) - Deadline (default) & NOOP

*Autogroup Scheduler - guaranteed to increase your cpu / memory 
performance

*CPU Turbo/Boost Enabled by default  - Screenshot here is showing 2.5 - 
2.68 ghz average CPU frequencies:

(again cpu is only rated 2.0 ghz with 
turbo boost to 2.4ghz.. this is adding an extra 100-300mhz per core 
while retaining minimal temps)

*CPU PCC Clock / Voltage Control with default governor Userspace (New)  
Controls Voltage / Freq based on temperature and processor demand. 
Basically removes restrictons and governs the processor states very 
efficiently to achieve optimal performance gain while keeping processor 
at coolest possible temp for the work load.  Very nice..



**TODO**

*Patch for PF-kernel / ck sources

*Add support for BFQ IO Scheduler

*Add Support for TuxOnIce

*Add support for Brain Fuck Scheduler

*Optimize GCC compiler for post-build kernel performance. 

*Add support for RT kernel.  For use with studio editing machines
